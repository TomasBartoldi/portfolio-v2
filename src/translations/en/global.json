        "description": "In the year 2013, I started undertaking a project based on a mobile application, but not as a developer. Working closely with developers, I realized my passion for technology. After a few years of working as a community manager, I realized I wasn't heading in the direction I wanted, so I decided to start self-learning the basics of programming. It wasn't until 2022 that I began my formal studies at Henry's bootcamp, aiming to become a Full Stack developer with knowledge of various technologies. Nowadays, I'm more oriented towards Front End. I focus on developing and designing scalable, intuitive UI."
